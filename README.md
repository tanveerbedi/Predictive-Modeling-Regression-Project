## 🛠️ End-to-End Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding & Preprocessing

* Loaded training and test data from Excel files
* Examined data structure, null values, datatypes, and distributions
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visual tools
* Performed data cleaning and preprocessing:

  * Null value imputation
  * Label encoding and one-hot encoding
  * Feature normalization or scaling (if required)

### 2. Model Development

* Applied multiple regression algorithms including:

  * Linear Regression
  * Ridge & Lasso Regression
  * Decision Tree Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor
  * XGBoost Regressor
* Performed cross-validation using `KFold` and `GridSearchCV`
* Compared model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² scores

### 3. Optimization & Final Inference

* Tuned model hyperparameters for optimal accuracy
* Selected the best-performing model based on validation scores
* Generated predictions for the test dataset
* Exported predictions in the required submission format
